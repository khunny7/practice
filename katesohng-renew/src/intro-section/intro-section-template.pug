All my earliest memories are related to sound, color, and storytelling: the moment when I sang for the very first time in my life, the color that most frequently appeared in my dreams, and the comicbook that I drew after reading a fairytale.  I am sure the reason that I still remember these so clearly even though they happened in my early childhood is that sound, color, and storytelling are the things about which I am most passionate. Thus, it was very natural that I started to have an interest in interactive media design. Also, I have learned how the media design can have a limitless possibility of expression by learning technology.'
        p.col-md-5.col-md-offset-1= 'So, I love to code and design and using them as tools that efficiently deliver messages to people. Recently, I started seeing the value of the ability to think critically, which I believe is essential to every interactive designer. A good interactive designer considers and integrates knowledge from different areas and creates artifacts with new ideas. I would like to be an interaction designer who delivers an indiscriminate message to a public that respects all human rights. Also, I will keep studying how to interact with people through code and design to evoke emotions that may lead people toward considerations of social justice issues.'
